# YaYaplot

Python visualization for text output of scientific simulations. (Shameless rip of Yaplot, which is difficult to build and is too limited for me.)

YaYaplot is built using [PyQTGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) and numpy.
These are typically part of every decent python distribution (e.g. Anaconda).
