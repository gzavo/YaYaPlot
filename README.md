# YaYaplot

YaYaPlot is a python visualization tool that keeps reading a text output of scientific simulations.
It provides a very minimalistic insight to what the simulation is doing.

It is a shameless rip of [Yaplot](https://github.com/vitroid/Yaplot), which was difficult to build and in some ways too limited for me.

YaYaplot is built using [PyQTGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) and numpy.

A proper README with documentation is inbound soon.
